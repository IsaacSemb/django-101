    "### **Django Learning Project - March 19, 2025**\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **Project Concept**\n",
    "Today, I decided that the best way to learn Django is by building a project that requires only a single model. The model Iâ€™ve chosen will deal with people or users. However, I will limit the scope of \"people\" because Django already includes built-in models for end users, which can make things more complex. \n",
    "\n",
    "Instead, Iâ€™ll create a custom model with a few unique attributes. Each record in the table will have at least four attributes, which will allow me to experiment with Djangoâ€™s features for data manipulation.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **Documenting the Process**\n",
    "Iâ€™ve been advised that documenting my learning journey will be beneficial. To facilitate this, I plan to log my progress daily and store these logs in a **Jupyter Notebook**. Each log entry will represent a day's work, and over time, I might transform these logs into blog posts if I decide to create a blog.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **Project Setup**\n",
    "Here's what Iâ€™ve done so far:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Created a Documentation Folder**  \n",
    "   - I set up a `docs/` folder to store all documentation related to the project.  \n",
    "   - Inside this folder:\n",
    "     - A **CLI Shortcuts** file will contain useful command-line shortcuts encountered during development.  \n",
    "     - A **Logging Folder** will hold daily logs of my progress, which Iâ€™ll document primarily through dictation and later refine.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Set Up the Development Environment**  \n",
    "   - Created a **virtual environment** using `pip` (instead of using a `Pipfile`).  \n",
    "   - Installed Django within this environment.  \n",
    "   - Used `pip freeze` to generate a `requirements.txt` file, ensuring that all dependencies are properly documented.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Initialized the Django Project**  \n",
    "   - After setting up the environment, I initialized a new Django project.  \n",
    "   - However, I later realized that I need to **refactor the project structure** so that all documentation and project files are well-organized.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Refactoring Considerations**  \n",
    "   - I want my terminal to start in the correct directory where `manage.py` is located, avoiding unnecessary navigation (`cd` commands) every time I open the terminal.  \n",
    "   - To achieve this, I might configure **VS Codeâ€™s `launch.json` settings** to automatically set the working directory to the correct location.  \n",
    "   - I will research more on how to properly configure this in the CLI.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "This version keeps all your points but makes them more structured and readable. Let me know if you need any modifications! ðŸš€"

    "\n",
    "\n",
    "So right now since I have chosen to use a single model for the framework, I'm having a problem with selecting what model I should choose. I know I had settled on people (users) where every record can have a person with a first name and last name, but then I think that's too simple.\n",
    "\n",
    "Another option is using other models. When I asked ChatGPT, it suggested models like **Products** (with a name, price, and inventory) and **Books** (with a name, author, and publication date). The books model is convenient because I want a dataset that allows me to perform multiple types of database manipulations, giving me a bigger learning base for Django ORM.\n",
    "\n",
    "I have an old dataset for books that I used a while back when playing around with Django. However, I got sidetracked and ended up learning Pandas instead. Thatâ€™s another big problem I haveâ€”getting distracted by other technologies instead of sticking to Django. I start learning Django, get a dataset to manipulate, and then suddenly, I think, \"Let me see what Pandas can do with this dataset.\" Then I abandon Django and dive into Pandas, even though I donâ€™t know it that well beyond basic commands like `read_csv()`.\n",
    "\n",
    "I'm going to try and work on avoiding distractions. Back to my main point: I have a dataset for books from Kaggle that is well documented, including ISBN, title, author, and even image links. That makes it a strong candidate for learning Django.\n",
